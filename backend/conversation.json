In this sense, the phrase \"The Public is not Common Good\" could be interpreted as a statement suggesting that the interests of the general public are not necessarily aligned with the common good.\n\nIn other words, just because something benefits many people (i.e., the public) does not necessarily mean it serves the greater good. This can be seen in situations where popular opinions or majority views may not always align with what is truly beneficial for society as a whole.\n\nFor example, a policy that is widely supported by the public but has negative consequences for certain groups or the environment might not be considered a common good. Similarly, a decision that benefits a small group of people at the expense of others could be seen as serving individual interests rather than the greater good.\n\nSo, in this sense, \"The Public is not Common Good\" can be seen as a reminder to critically evaluate decisions and policies to ensure they align with the well-being of all members of society, rather than just catering to popular opinion or special interests."
