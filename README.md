**Real-time Audio Translation with Interactive Responses **

This project provides a real-time audio translation system with interactive responses, enabling seamless translation between English and Hindi, as well as English and Nepali. The workflow is as follows:
- Audio Decoding: The system utilizes the Vosk model to transcribe audio input in real-time.
- Translation: The transcribed text is translated using a custom translation model and Llama, providing accurate and context-aware translations.
- Response Generation: Llama is also employed to generate natural and coherent responses based on the translated text.
- Audio Output: The final output is then converted to speech using ElevenLab.
This project is designed to provide an efficient, interactive, and smooth translation and communication tool.
